Dark current is a very large limiting factor in the performance of an image sensor.  Image sensors work by generating a signal when an area of the signal has a different light level than the rest and it is able to then generate a pixel.  Dark currents "occur in every pixel, but vary from pixel-to-pixel" based on a number of factors such as heat on the image sensor.(Dan McGrath 2018)
