\par Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors are one of the most common modern methods of creating digital image sensors. \autoref{fig:filters} illustrates how light passing from the outside passes through a glass lens and a color filter before finally reaching the photo-diodes.

\par The photo-diode is sensitive to light and is able to generate a current when exposed to photons. Lastly, that signal is sent to a central processor and translated into a pixel\cite{Tokyo_Electron_Committee}. Because of the required exposure to photons, CMOS sensors receive excessive radiation emissions and are vulnerable to a higher than noraml number of faults. \autoref{fig:CMOS} shows a basic schematic for a CMOS sensor. The photo diode has to be exposed to the incoming light so that it can activate the circuit, however, this makes it vulnerable to any other interference that can potentially harm the sensor.

\par One fault that often occurs in CMOS sensors is dark current. A dark current is when the CMOS circuit is activated by a wave that is not a photon \cite{mcgrath_tobin_goiffon_magan_2018}. The inaccuracy in images due to dark current induced noise is a major limiting factor in the reliability of CMOS sensor systems. Radiation that reaches a sensor is likely to cause some kind of fault, and if the intensity of the radiation is high enough a pixel can become permanently damaged \cite{bardoux_penquer_gilard_ecoffet_auvergne_2017}. Dark currents cause the wrong signal to be sent to the central processor and results in noise or a collection of white pixels.  These faults can be harmless to the sensor at first, but given enough time to build up they can eventually render a sensor useless.
