\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this paper the effectiveness of detecting and correcting radiation-induced errors in an image sensor is explored. This provides an alternative on past methods by correcting and detecting faults in the image processing module, rather than a hardware level redesign. While using software to mitigate the effects of radiation on sensors is not a permanent solution, the benefits of significant reduced costs and development make this solution  appealing for non-critical applications. This project targets uses in control cameras at a radiation plants or other radiation intensive conditions where fault mitigation is desired. This will allow systems that use cameras in these conditions to operate with higher reliability and provide higher fidelity imagery despite the operating conditions of the cameras. Additionally, this solution provides enhanced reporting to the end user, unlike traditional image processing techniques.
