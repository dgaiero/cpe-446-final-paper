\par Further work can be done to produce HDL code or package the SIMULINK\textregisteredmark\ model into an IP package for deployment on an FPGA. Modules in \autoref{fig:sysSpecs} with a yellow background color are made with HDL blocks. Input and output blocks will have to be modified to support the correct data as well as certain SIMULINK\textregisteredmark\ computer vision blocks that performed parts of the video reading, processing, and output. However, this addition could make this model a viable option to flash onto an FPGA. This implemented design could be the truth model for any implemented IP.
