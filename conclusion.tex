\par Further work can be done to produce HDL code or package the SIMULINK\textregisteredmark\ model into an IP package for deployment on an FPGA. Modules in \autoref{fig:sysSpecs} with a yellow background color are made with HDL blocks. Input and output blocks will have to be modified to support the correct data as well as certain SIMULINK\textregisteredmark\ computer vision blocks that performed parts of the video reading, processing, and output. However, this addition could make this model a viable option to flash onto an FPGA. This implemented design could be the truth model for any implemented IP. This method to remove noise from images has potential in harsh environments to make image sensors more reliable. For critical systems such as star trackers, however, radiation hardening the CMOS sensor would be necessary to meet customer requirements. This cost-effective solution would be suitable for applications such as standard cameras on spacecraft (such as the cameras used by astronauts aboard the International Space Station) and control cameras at nuclear plants. This would allow for more reliable imaging for the types of errors that are expected in those environments and allow for an effective longer lifetime of the sensors in these systems. Software correction is a viable alternative to radiation hardening image sensors in low cost, low risk environments.
