\par Dark currents are the main source of faults due to radiation and are therefore the target for error correction when designing a solution to radiation hardening CMOS sensors. The approach presented in this paper capitalizes on software detection and correction which provides cost-saving benefits over traditional hardware redesign. Since some CMOS sensors must operate in harsh environments, many groups focused on redesigning the MOS capacitor at a fundamental level. T. Wantabe and his team redesigned the MOS capacitor from the ground up \cite{wantabe_takeuchi_ozawa_akahori_tsuchiya_2017} to better prevent dark currents interfering with the function of the sensor and made the sensor radiation hardened.
