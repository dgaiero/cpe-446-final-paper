Final Paper
- Background on CMOS
- Background on Radiation Events (with regards to CMOS)
- How radiation can interfere with CMOS stuffs
- How is this problem currently being addressed?

- Our thing
   - Aiming for transient and peppermint faults.
   - Use MATLAB to identify location of faults in image
   - Remove faults from image (average area around it?)
   - profit!


Cameras in harsh environments are exposed to high dosages to radiation. These doses are difficult to deal with in the sensor (because the sensor is exposed)
- Currently, some solutions use hardware changes to make the sensors rad-hard.
   - Good for environments where you cannot replace the camera, but this is extremely expensive.

Use software to identify pixels that are "out of place" - one pixel that is white, and if a CMOS sensor is heavly damaged by radiation wave - cmos is broken
 - We are saying we can take a software approach to try and identify different types of faults
 
- Also look at noise in images (not just harsh environments) - what has been done in that area.
   - What are the other sources of nosie and what are the techniques they use to de-noise.
   - Errors from DSP
   - Noise introduced from high-sensitivity sensors
